0-8:     Alright, I am going to be unboxing and reviewing the Cascade Platinum Plus pots for the dishwasher.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=0s
8-12:     I'm going to actually be putting these to use to see how well it cleans my dishes.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=8s
12-20:     I'm going to go ahead and open this up. So it comes in a container and I'm going to simply put my finger right here and pull this.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=12s
21-33:     And it exposes the product inside. And inside is the washing pot to put in the washer.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=21s
33-39:     And I'm about to put this in here to show you how well it cleans, to see how well it cleans, to see if it's worth it.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=33s
39-44:     Right here. And so here it is right here. Here's the pot.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=39s
44-48:     Let me go ahead and put this into the dishwasher.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=44s
50-57:     Alright, so here is the pot right here. You see it comes in three different colors as well as the powder pack on the underneath side.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=50s
57-68:     And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to look inside of the dishwasher and see there's a cup right here with, looks like cheese, spaghetti sauce in there.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=57s
68-72:     I used that to pack for my lunch and it is quite messy in there.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=68s
72-77:     I did not rinse it out so we'll see what the Cascade pot can do.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=72s
77-82:     The utensils are fairly dirty. A lot of stuff on there. The pot is slightly dirty, not too bad.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=77s
82-90:     Now look at this cup right here. This cup actually has coffee, chocolate, I mean mocha choco latte in there and so it comes pretty stained.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=82s
90-94:     I have a container for my lunch that I had spaghetti in there.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=90s
94-98:     And then there is a bowl with spaghetti on there too.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=94s
98-102:     So this is going to be a heavy wash. Some things in there, a knife that's pretty dirty.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=98s
103-107:     So this is going to be like a pretty good wash, not a heavy load.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=103s
107-110:     We'll test out the Cascade pot. There it is right here.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=107s
110-117:     I'm going to place this inside of the container, close it and turn it on.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=110s
117-122:     Make it a speed one hour wash or 60 minutes, whatever you want to call it.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=117s
122-128:     And I'll press start and then I'm going to see what it looks like after it gets done.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=122s
129-132:     Alright, so the wash is completed so let's check up on it.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=129s
132-137:     So I'm going to go ahead and open this up and look in here.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=132s
137-140:     There's a little steam coming out. So we're going to check out the dishes.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=137s
140-145:     Alright, now remember that one cup that was filled with cheese on the sides of it.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=140s
145-151:     Well it is clean now. As you can see it's sparkling clean except for one spot that's in there.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=145s
151-155:     It seems like some cheese or crud is still on there.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=151s
155-160:     And now when I say I'm not blaming the pot for not being able to get this,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=155s
160-165:     this thing was pretty dirty and it probably should have been rinsed out before I put it in there.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=160s
165-168:     So that's just one area where it did not clean.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=165s
168-171:     Alright, so let's check out this. That came really clean.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=168s
171-178:     Alright, the utensils. You see utensils are nice and clean, nothing on there.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=171s
178-184:     Now let's check out the top. Looks like a cup got turned over in here and water got collected.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=178s
184-190:     But right here, let's look at this right here where it had chocolate, coffee, whatever in it.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=184s
190-194:     It is crystal clean. And remember that bowl?    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=190s
194-199:     Bowl is nice and clean. There's a little bit of fog in there from the steam still rising.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=194s
199-202:     But this came clean, absolutely clean.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=199s
202-206:     And remember that spaghetti bowl back there? Look at that pristine clean.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=202s
206-210:     So overall, I think this did a really good job.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=206s
210-215:     The Platinum Plus right here, the Cascade Platinum Plus did a really good job.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=210s
215-217:     I'm pretty impressed by it.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=215s
217-220:     Alright, hopefully that was helpful. Thanks a lot for watching.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sT2e-L0pNA&t=217s
