Title: Best Diapers of 2024: Coterie Diaper Review
Description: 've used Coterie diapers https://coterie.sjv.io/nLxz0a for over 2 years for my kid's new born, baby and toddler stages. And in this video I will tell you why I love them and personally believe they are the best diapers of 2024.

0-2:     I bet you are trying to find the best diapers    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=0s
2-4:     for your precious little one, aren't you?    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=2s
4-5:     I know how you feel.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=4s
5-8:     I'm a mother of a five and a two-year-old.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=5s
8-10:     I've tried a lot of diaper brands    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=8s
10-13:     and I have come across one that I stopped at    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=10s
13-15:     and I've been using for over two years now.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=13s
15-17:     That is why I wanna share with you guys    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=15s
17-20:     the brand that I think is the best out there,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=17s
20-22:     the Cottery or Cottery.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=20s
22-22:     I don't know how to say it.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=22s
22-24:     This brand right here,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=22s
24-27:     this is my personal experience and my personal opinion,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=24s
27-31:     so I recommend you go and try them out for yourself    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=27s
31-32:     before you believe me.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=31s
32-34:     So there are four main things to consider    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=32s
34-36:     when choosing a diaper brand.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=34s
36-40:     That is ingredients, absorbency, comfort, and price.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=36s
40-43:     And I will go over these four topics briefly    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=40s
43-46:     to hopefully help you in your decision-making process.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=43s
46-50:     I will also link to these diapers in my description below    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=46s
50-52:     for your convenience so you can check them out.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=50s
52-54:     So first of all, it's the ingredients.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=52s
54-58:     They are made of 25% plant-based material    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=54s
58-62:     and they're also free of 200 plus harsh chemicals,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=58s
62-63:     which to me is a big deal.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=62s
63-68:     Has no fragrances, no lotions, latex, rubber, dyes, alcohol,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=63s
69-73:     heavy metals, parabens, pesticides, or chlorine bleaching.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=69s
73-74:     That's a big deal.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=73s
74-76:     To me, that's a good enough list to be like,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=74s
76-77:     what a relief, you know?    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=76s
77-80:     And then I also really like that they are just plain white    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=77s
80-84:     because if you are wearing a cute outfit for your baby,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=80s
84-86:     that's just like a thin material,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=84s
86-89:     you don't really, I don't really want a pattern    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=86s
89-91:     or some color to show through their clothes.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=89s
91-93:     So I do appreciate just the white look.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=91s
93-95:     Second is the absorbency.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=93s
95-98:     This is the best diaper I have found    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=95s
98-100:     with this kind of absorbency.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=98s
100-102:     It can hold 70% more liquid    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=100s
102-104:     than other leading diaper brands.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=102s
104-107:     Like at night, you don't have to worry about leaks    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=104s
107-108:     or blowouts.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=107s
108-110:     And I have tried other ones.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=108s
110-113:     I've tried Pampers and Honest,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=110s
113-114:     and I've had so many blowouts with those,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=113s
114-116:     especially with my newborn baby.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=114s
116-119:     But with Cottery, I did not have a problem    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=116s
119-122:     with any blowouts or leaks at all.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=119s
122-123:     And I'm not exaggerating.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=122s
123-125:     And the awesome thing is the material    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=123s
125-127:     that's holding the liquid in here    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=125s
127-131:     is absorbed in such a way that keeps your skin dry.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=127s
131-133:     So the baby's skin is a lot more drier    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=131s
133-135:     than other brands that you would try out there.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=133s
135-137:     So sometimes life gets busy,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=135s
137-140:     and I just, sometimes it's been that I did forget    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=137s
140-142:     to change my baby's diaper,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=140s
142-143:     even though it was full.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=142s
143-144:     And for a long time,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=143s
144-148:     I never had problems with rash or itching.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=144s
148-150:     So absorbency, just excellent.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=148s
150-153:     It also does have this wetness indicator,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=150s
153-156:     this line that changes color when the diaper is wet.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=153s
156-158:     So it kind of lets you know to change them.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=156s
158-160:     And I think most diapers have that.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=158s
160-162:     The third thing is the comfort.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=160s
162-164:     These, seriously, if you try them,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=162s
164-166:     they're very, very soft.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=164s
166-168:     I think something that would be close to the softness    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=166s
168-171:     of this diaper would be the Pampers Pure.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=168s
171-173:     I used them before, and they are very soft,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=171s
173-177:     but still I would get leaks in those ones, not in these.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=173s
177-180:     So these are super duper soft material.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=177s
180-182:     And I really like these, like the ruffles here,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=180s
182-184:     they're a little bit bigger, like longer.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=182s
184-187:     And I appreciate that because then you can see very clearly    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=184s
187-189:     if anything's folded inside    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=187s
189-191:     or like something's not aligned properly.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=189s
191-193:     You just see it very nicely.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=191s
193-194:     It's like obvious.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=193s
194-196:     And they're very easy to move around in.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=194s
196-199:     My kids just run and play,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=196s
199-200:     and I never see them itching    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=199s
200-205:     or having some kind of a discomfort unless they pooped.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=200s
205-206:     But that's about it.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=205s
206-208:     And so I have a lot of nephews,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=206s
208-210:     and I was changing one of my nephews one day,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=208s
210-213:     and of course his brand of diaper was something else.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=210s
213-216:     And I saw some lines on the creases of his legs,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=213s
216-217:     and he was itching there.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=216s
217-219:     And I'm like, man, buddy,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=217s
219-221:     tell your mom to get a different diaper brand.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=219s
221-222:     Come on, man.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=221s
222-225:     But it's just sad to see little kids like uncomfortable,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=222s
225-226:     but they can't really tell you.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=225s
226-228:     And so that is kind of a big deal.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=226s
228-229:     Like you want your kids comfortable.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=228s
229-231:     They're wearing these all day long.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=229s
231-232:     It's on their butt.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=231s
232-234:     And I just care for my kids,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=232s
234-235:     so I want them to be comfortable.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=234s
235-237:     Lastly is the price.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=235s
237-240:     So there's different ways that you can purchase these.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=237s
240-242:     If you want just one pack,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=240s
242-243:     you would have to get it at a store.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=242s
243-245:     And I know that Whole Foods sell them.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=243s
245-246:     That's where I used to buy them.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=245s
246-249:     I don't know what other stores would carry this brand,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=246s
249-251:     but I know Whole Foods does.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=249s
251-253:     So there I would buy per one pack.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=251s
253-256:     It would range from 17.99 to 19.99,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=253s
256-257:     depending on what size you're getting    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=256s
257-259:     and if there's a sale or not.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=257s
259-262:     I found out there's another option, and that is online.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=259s
262-264:     On cottery.com, they have an option    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=262s
264-267:     to buy a full month worth of supply.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=264s
267-268:     And that would be for $100.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=267s
268-272:     Or you could do a subscription for their auto renew,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=268s
272-275:     and that's $90, so $10 cheaper.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=272s
275-276:     And that's for any size.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=275s
276-278:     So just a flat rate for any size diapers.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=276s
278-281:     I finally did the auto renew subscription    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=278s
281-286:     because I found myself wasting too much time    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=281s
286-288:     going to the store, buying a pack of diapers    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=286s
288-289:     when I was running out,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=288s
289-292:     and it caused a lot of like headache and stress,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=289s
292-294:     and it wasted my time.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=292s
294-296:     So I'm like, fine, I'll get the subscription.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=294s
296-298:     And so I just tried it out,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=296s
298-299:     and I ended up keeping it for a while    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=298s
299-301:     because it was so convenient.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=299s
301-304:     Like you can cancel, you can pause it,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=301s
304-306:     and you can change the size of your diapers    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=304s
306-308:     whenever you're ready to like size up.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=306s
308-310:     So that was super nice.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=308s
310-311:     By the way, this is not sponsored.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=310s
311-313:     I'm not trying to promote,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=311s
313-315:     but like I'm just sharing my experience.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=313s
315-316:     It's a big deal, you know,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=315s
316-317:     it's a big part of your kid's journey    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=316s
317-319:     and like mothering and parenting.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=317s
319-321:     So that's why I'm talking about this    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=319s
321-323:     because I am a mother too.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=321s
323-326:     So yes, these do cost more.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=323s
326-328:     My sister was telling me,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=326s
328-330:     oh, isn't it sad for you to pay that much money    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhH_fTMDtB0&t=328s
